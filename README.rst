Package organization
--------------------

This packaging process is based on https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/

Scripts added to the package aim have at least 90% test coverage.


Scripts
-------

Combining/processing output:

align_on_col
  For combining data from multiple files based on a common timestep. All other data will be ignored or, if in logging
  mode, printed to a log file.

fes_combo
  Combines multiple FES output files into a single file so that the first
  column's value is sequential.  Files with higher starting index numbers
  are favored.

filter_col_data
  Produces a file in which only rows are reproduced that pass filtering criteria set in the configuration file. The
  config file allows specifying max and/or min values for any column heading

path_bin
  Creates a summary VMD XYZ file (and separate log file) that averages a
  set of coordinates (one set of XYZ coordinates per line) from an input file.

pdb_edit
  Creates a new version of a pdb file applying options such as renumbering molecules.

per_col_stats
  Given a file with columns of data, returns the min, max, avg, and std dev per column. Optionally, it can return
  the maximum value from each column plus a "buffer" length (useful for preparing CP2K input for FitEVB).

press_dups
  Compresses lines in a given CSV based on duplicate values in a specified
  column (RMSD by default)  Compressed lines have their values averaged.


For PMF calculations:

md_init
  Initializes a location for running md utilities. Specifically, it makes template files for creating wham input.

wham_split
  Breaks wham input into increasingly smaller blocks (divide initial data set
  by 2, then 3, 4...) and creates wham input (meta) files and submit scripts.

wham_rad
  Calculates the radially-corrected free energy values from WHAM output.

calc_pka
  From the wham_rad output, calculates the pKa.


Processing LAMMPS output:

data_edit
  offers a range of options to produce a new, edited data file (such as renumbering interactions types), or to
  output selected data (i.e. interactions involving or owned by a particular atom number)

dump_edit
  available options include renumbering atoms or molecules and producing a new file with a subset of timesteps

lammps_dist
  Calculates the distances between a given set of atom pairs for each
  time step in a given LAMMPS dump file

lammps_proc_data
  From lammps dump file(s), finds key distance, such as the hydroxyl OH distance on the protonatable residue
  (when protonated). This script assumes we care about one protonatable residue in a simulation with a PBC.


For RAPTOR or EVBFit/RMDFit:

convert_cp2k_forces
  cp2k force output files

evb_get_info
  collects selected data form evb output files such as the number of states, the maximum ci^2 value for a protonated
  state, and the max ci^2 value for a deprotonated state

fitevb_setup
  provided a allowable ranges of parameters and results of a previous fitting step, creates a new fitevb input file

process_cv_file
  converts plumed cv output to evb cv output style
